    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Kentucky Internet Speed Compared to Population</h3>
    <p>This map shows the average internet speed (In megabits [Not megabytes] per second) based on speedtests performed in 2020 through Ookla. There are published on Ookla Open Datasets. County population and notable infrastructure, terrain, and administrative boundaries/lables are also shown as I believe they are relevant in understanding variance in internet speed across the state. Speed is displayed in colors ranging from deep blue for low speeds and a bright yellow for high speeds as similar to the color scheming of Ookla's speedtest application. Population is displayed alongside speed in hex height.</p>
    <p>As the map shows,  internet speed spikes in areas with high population concentrations and along major highways. As terrain restricts ideal internet infrastructure, speeds slow in mountainous regions and near large bodies of water such as Lake Cumberland and Cave Run. (Note: areas with no hexes are not necessarily "dead zones" for internet connection, but rather areas where no speedtests were conducted in 2020).</p>
    <p>Ookla's speed data originally came in a shapefile format consisting of miniature squares with average speeds in kbps. I converted these squares into points then did the math to convert kbps to mbps as this is more clear for viewing purposes. Population data from the American Community Survey was then joined to a shapefile of Kentucky's counties. Finally, each speed point was assigned value pertaining to its county of origin and population data was finally joined with the speed points into a single csv.</p>
    <p>While I had intention to add some infrastructure data (such as major and minor roads) to the map in shapefile format, I found that these attributes were more professionally (and conveniently) displayed using a base layer created in Mapbox. This base layer includes state and county boundaries, major and minor cities, roads, bodies of water, and terrain.
